## Required Reading

In order to understand the C platform API, one must first be familiar with the
[OpenTracing project](http://opentracing.io) and
[terminology](http://opentracing.io/documentation/pages/spec) more generally.

## C/C++98

This library requires C++11 or later. But if you're interested in a C or C++98
API contact us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/opentracing/opentracing-cpp?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge).
We're open to supporting additional APIs in a separate repository if there are
people willing to maintain it.
